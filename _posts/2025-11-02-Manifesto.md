e11iptic is a community for privacy & security practitioners.

We began as a Discord server focused on [competitive audits](https://support.cyfrin.io/en/articles/10059182-what-is-a-competitive-audit), this was a collaborative effort to break into smart contract security research.

Today, we bring experts and enthusiasts together, to learn, build and break in security research and privacy enhancing technologies. We love playing positive sum games. When the game is not, we play to win. We hold ourselves, and each other, to a higher standard.

We run hacker houses as well as online events.
