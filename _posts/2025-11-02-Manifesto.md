We're contributors in security research and verifiable compute.

We started as a stealth study group early 2023, the goal was to break into smart contract security research. Since then, our researchers placed first in over 10 [competitive audits](https://docs.codehawks.com/hawks-auditors/what-is-an-auditing-competition).

Today, we bring experts and enthusiasts together to learn, build and break in security research and verifiable compute. We love creating and playing positive sum games. When the game is not, we play to win. We hold ourselves and each other to a higher standard.

We got nerd sniped to [verifiable compute](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/verifiable-computing/) as an extension of our security research, only to realise such technologies, are larger in scope than just verifying proofs inside a smart contract. They're based on beautiful mathematics, we see beauty in mathematics.

e11iptic welcomes all who reasonate with the above. We host hacker houses as well as online events.
