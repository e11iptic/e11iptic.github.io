We're a non-profit for privacy & security practitioners. We started as a Discord server discussing [competitive audits](https://support.cyfrin.io/en/articles/10059182-what-is-a-competitive-audit), a collaborative approach to security research.

Today, we're a community of experts and enthusiasts in privacy technologies and security research. We run both online events and in person hacker houses.
