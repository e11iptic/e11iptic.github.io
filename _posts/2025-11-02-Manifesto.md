e11iptic is a community for privacy & security practitioners.

We started as a Discord server focused on [competitive audits](https://support.cyfrin.io/en/articles/10059182-what-is-a-competitive-audit), this was a collaborative effort to get into security research. We love playing positive sum games. When the game is not, we play to win. We hold ourselves, and each other, to a higher standard.

Today, we're a community of experts and enthusiasts in security research and privacy-enhancing technologies. We welcome anyone who shares our mindset to engage in our online community and join our in person hacker houses.
