There's no shortage in intros and roadmaps to smart contracts security: [[1]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kdHLMWQvWg). The no bullshit way is is to first master the fundamentals: how a blockchain works, how its vm executes transactions, what are basic attack vectors. Once you've done that, you want to immediately test your hacker mindset. 

This post goal is to answer, from a security reseacher perspective: **why do smart contracts security? and where to get started?**

## Why?

Smart contracts are code that handles funds. In the worse case scenario, the threat model is simple: steal those funds.

Blackhats have become increasingly sophisticated, often depleting contracts in a single well crafted transaction. [In Yearn Finance hack](https://x.com/BautiDeFi/status/1995486172513022420), the attacker deployed attack contracts, executed the attack, and self destructed the contracts, all in one single transaction, stealing over $9M. One could even argue [there's some beauty on it](https://x.com/fran_rimoldi/status/1995487656076275747?s=20). Whitehats have a hard job here because with real funds at stake, a good whitehat must be as capable as the most sophisticated blackhat. 


This piece is for hackers who are intrigued by the threat model of stealing funds, and being as capable as the most sophisticated blackhat. As long hacks as still happening, there's room for more whitehats.

## Where to get a started?

- Learn from previous hacks. 
- Take a free course at [Cyfrin Updraft](https://www.cyfrin.io/updraft).
- Read technical posts at [RareSkills](https://rareskills.io/blog).

Where to hunt for bugs and get payed?

Two options there: either do bug bounties, or audit contests.

- Bug bounties is about finding criticals in live code, programs run continuously, so you’re competing against time blackhats exploiting it, and other whitehats reporting it before you do.  
- Audit contests are time-boxed reviews where many researchers audit the same codebase before its deployment. They have a quick feedback loop because you get to read others' submissions and learn from what you missed.

Here's a bug bounties/contests aggregator that you can check for live programs: [[bug bounties]](https://www.vigilseek.com/bug-bounty), [[contests]](https://www.vigilseek.com/).
