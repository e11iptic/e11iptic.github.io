Smart contracts are code that handles funds. In the worse case scenario, the threat model is around stealing those funds.

Blackhats get sophisticated in depleting contracts, which can happen in a single well crafted transaction. [In a recent Yearn Finance hack](https://x.com/BautiDeFi/status/1995486172513022420), the attacker deployed attack contracts, executed the attack, tornado cashed part of the profits, and self destructed the contracts, all in one single transaction. Whitehats have a hard job here because with real funds at stake, a good whitehat must be as capable as the most sophisticated blackhat.

This piece is for hackers that entertained the threat model around stealing funds and being as capable as the most sophisticated blackhat. As long hacks as still happening, the space has room for more whitehats.
