## Why?

Smart contracts are code that handles funds. In the worse case scenario, the threat model is around stealing those funds.

Blackhats get sophisticated in depleting contracts, which can happen in a single well crafted transaction. [In Yearn Finance hack](https://x.com/BautiDeFi/status/1995486172513022420), the attacker deployed attack contracts, executed the attack, and self destructed the contracts, all in one single transaction, stealing over $9M. One could even argue [there's some beauty on it](https://x.com/fran_rimoldi/status/1995487656076275747?s=20). Whitehats have a hard job here because with real funds at stake, a good whitehat must be as capable as the most sophisticated blackhat. 


This piece is for hackers that entertained the threat model around stealing funds and being as capable as the most sophisticated blackhat. As long hacks as still happening, the space has room for more whitehats.

## Where to get a started?

There's no shortage in intros and roadmaps to smart contracts security. The no bullshit way is to educate yourself on the foundations (how a blockchain works, how its vm executes transactions, what are basic attack vectors). Once you've done that, you want to immediately test your hacker mindset in audit contests. Audit contests have a quick feedback loop because you get to read others' submissions and learn from what you missed. 

- Learn from previous hacks. 
- Read technical posts at [RareSkills](https://rareskills.io/blog).
- Take a free course at [Cyfrin Updraft](https://www.cyfrin.io/updraft).

Where to hunt for bugs and get payed?

Two options there: either do audit contests, or bug bounty.

- There are a couple of contest aggregators that you can check for live contests: [[1]](https://www.dailywarden.com/) and [[2]](https://www.vigilseek.com/).

- For bug bounty, check each bug bounty platform for its live programs:
  - [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/).
  - [Cantina](https://cantina.xyz/opportunities/bounties). 
  
Where to go from there?
It's for you to figure out, anon.
